# MIM-attack-ESP32
ever thought about hacking wifi passwords with the esp32 ? well now you can!!

you are free to use my code hence I made it public but please consider giving me credit I would really appretiate it thanks!

also use this for educational purposes only

now to perform this attack you need an ESP32-WROOM-32UE and an external antena for longer range if you want it's optional though
also you need the arduino IDE to upload the code to the esp32 through a cable and to do that you need to download the esp32 library
