# MIM-attack-ESP32
ever thought about hacking wifi passwords with the esp32 ? well now you can!!

you are free to use my code hence I made it public but please consider giving me credit I would really appretiate it thanks!

also use this for educational purposes only

now to perform this attack you need an ESP32-WROOM-32UE and an external antena for longer range if you want it's optional though
also you need the arduino IDE to upload the code to the esp32 through a cable and to do that you need to download the esp32 library
after everything is set up go to the source_code in this repository and you can download the arduinoIDEfile.ino and double click it and upload the code or you could just 
copy and paste the code from raw code for the esp32.txt file and then upload it in arduino keep in mind that the password and ip address that is enterd by the victim device will be shown in the serial monitor in the arduino ide.
